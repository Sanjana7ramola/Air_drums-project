# my project : Air drums- Playing drums using computer vision
 description : The project is to develop a virtual drumming system that enables aspiring 
drummers to practice and learn how to play the drums without the need for a physical drum 
set. This system aims to use computer vision and real-time audio synthesis to translate the 
movements of a user playing "air drums" into corresponding drum sounds, thereby 
providing an accessible, cost-effective, and space-efficient solution for drum training. The 
project leverages a laptop's built-in webcam to capture the user's motions, interpreting these 
into accurate drumming audio outputs, thus making drumming practice possible virtually 
anywhere and anytime.
